**PRINTF**
* The printf project is a programming exercise often found in C-based curricula or coding platforms, where the goal is to implement a custom version of the printf function. printf is one of the most widely used functions in C for output, typically used to print formatted strings to the console.
* In this project, instead of using the standard library's built-in printf function, the goal is to create your own version that mimics its behavior. The implementation typically involves handling different format specifiers, such as %d, %s, %f, and others, to print integers, strings, floating-point numbers, and more.
